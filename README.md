# Now Playing for Spotify 
Copies the track name you're listening to on Spotify to your clipboard.

# Usage
Run the application while Spotify isn't running or is paused, so that the application can pick up on the "Spotify" window name and create a handle.

The application will search for the handle every 5 seconds if it doesn't find it when first launched, so pausing the song on Spotify after launching the application is also sufficient.

# Keybinds

Alt+Q: Copies the song to the clipboard.
Alt+X: Terminates the application.
